1) Channel estimation based on pilots: (see my note based on lecture 2&7&8 )
- create a preamble composed merely of pilots: more than 5, less than 256
- channel estimation based on interpolation of division of Tx preamble by Rx preamble (composed of pilots only as mentioned before)
- more relative power than 0db (relative versus data sc's)
- different phases: to decrease PAPR. in the case pilots are dominant in 
terms of power, we need them to get summed de-phased

2) SNR estimation via preamble metric (Yuval Ben Hur)

3) Coarse time synch with clean preamble produced by receiver: correlation
between that and the received preamble sequence.  better on noisy channel.
the other method, of autocorrlating the Rx sequence with itself, is better 
on dominance of multipath over noise

4) channel estimation at every block

5) LMS equalizer: BFB, p.719-720


7) Vocoder: LPC10. Fs=8Ksps, quaantization: 8 logarithmic or 12 linear

8) improevement of clock synch with the aid of preamble_CE


9) N_FFT=64; increase preamble gain enhacement above 4dB. it is possible
10) Add single carrier narrow band preamble testifying of the gain enhancement (linear terms: more accurate)
11) add Signal field preamble carrying information about the rest of the packet (BFB, p.715-716)



13) Equalizer: improve according to article: WLS_OFDM_channel_equalization (to be found under aricles folder) 

14) speech compression using DCT:

15) Transition to 1024 carriers

16)working on real-timeness of OFDM_Link_function in HW mode:
vocoder,
sampling frequency of voice
quantization of voice
coding overhead
modulation
BW of Signal
Rx/Tx filters designs or convolution (maybe save ans load)
CP

17) Phase estimation: use LS method making use of pilots 

18) pre emphasis of chirp using differentiator
