all the following with:
N_symbols=8000

1)OFDM Link function:
    a)  Calibration& 4-QAM& SNR=400dB: EVM~54dB

 2)on calibration mode:

    %%% 1) on EbNo mode: EbNo~EVM-log10(log2(M)) (e.g; M=4&EbNo=30, EVM=-33 on every signal length)
    %%% 2) on EsNo_data mode: EsNo~EVM(e.g; EsNo=30, EVM=-30 on every constellation and every signal length)

 3)on calibration mode: BER curve is well aligned with theory

4) Operational Mode: actual BER curve is aligned with saved curves

5) HW: EVM reached is above 45dB (even 57dB is reachable!). check the Frec and Fs to avoid aliasing and also the Average power at AFE time domin:
Rx and Tx should have approximately same height. if not, change A/D or D/A ports, or reset them (maybe RF cable)
